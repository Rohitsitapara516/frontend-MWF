<.... What is CSS Flexbox : What is CSS Flexbox, and how is it useful for layout design? 
CSS Flexbox, or the Flexible Box Layout, is a layout model in CSS that provides a more efficient way to design complex layouts and align items within a container. It allows for responsive design by enabling items to adjust and distribute space within a container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic. Flexbox is particularly useful for creating one-dimensional layouts, either in a row or a column, making it easier to align and distribute space among items.


Explain the terms flex-container and flex-item.

1.Flex Container:
The flex container is the parent element that holds the flex items. To create a flex container, you apply the display: flex; or display: inline-flex; property to an element. This establishes a new flex formatting context for its direct children (the flex items).
The flex container controls the layout of its children, allowing for properties that define how the items are aligned, spaced, and ordered.

2.Flex Items:
Flex items are the direct children of a flex container. These items can be any HTML elements, such as <div>, <span>, or <p>.
Flex items can be manipulated using various flex properties to control their size, alignment, and order within the flex container. Some common properties include flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis, which determine how items grow or shrink to fill available space

<... Explain the concept of CSS specificity
 CSS specificity is a set of rules that determines which CSS styles are applied to an element when there are conflicting styles. It is a crucial concept in CSS because it helps resolve conflicts when multiple rules could apply to the same element. Understanding specificity allows developers to write more predictable and maintainable styles.

 Conflicts Resolution
When multiple styles apply to the same element, the browser resolves conflicts based on the following rules:

1.Inline styles have the highest specificity and will override any other styles.

2.ID selectors are more specific than class selectors and element selectors.

3.Class selectors are more specific than element selectors.

4.If two selectors have the same specificity, the one that appears last in the CSS will take precedence.

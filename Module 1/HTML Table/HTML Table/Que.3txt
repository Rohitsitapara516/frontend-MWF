3:Why should tables be used sparingly for layout purposes? What is a better
alternative?

<... Tables for Layout
1.Semantic Meaning: Tables are designed to display tabular data, not for layout. Using them for layout purposes can confuse screen readers and other assistive technologies, leading to a poor experience for users with disabilities. It can also mislead developers and maintainers about the intended use of the markup.

2.Accessibility Issues: When tables are used for layout, it can complicate navigation for users who rely on assistive technologies. Screen readers may announce table structures in ways that are not meaningful in a layout context, making it difficult for users to understand the content.

3.Maintenance Challenges: Tables can become complex and difficult to maintain, especially as designs change. Modifying a layout that uses tables often requires significant changes to the HTML structure, which can lead to errors and inconsistencies.

4.Responsiveness: Tables are not inherently responsive. When using tables for layout, it can be challenging to make them adapt to different screen sizes and devices. This can lead to poor user experiences on mobile devices.

5.Performance: Tables can lead to larger HTML files and slower rendering times, especially if they are nested or overly complex. This can negatively impact page load times and overall performance.

1.CSS Flexbox: Flexbox is a layout model that allows for responsive design and alignment of elements in a one-dimensional space (either row or column). It is great for creating flexible layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.

2.CSS Grid: CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that allows for more complex layouts. It enables developers to create grid-based designs with rows and columns, making it easier to control the placement of elements.

3.Semantic HTML Elements: Use semantic HTML elements like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, and <footer> to structure your content. This improves accessibility and SEO while providing a clear structure for the document.

4.Media Queries: Use CSS media queries to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes. This allows you to change styles based on the viewport size, ensuring a good user experience on all devices.

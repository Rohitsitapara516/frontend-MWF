 1: Explain the structure of an HTML table and the purpose of each of the following
elements: <table>, <tr>, <th>, <td>, and <thead>

<...
HTML tables are used to display data in a structured format, allowing for easy organization and presentation of information in rows and columns. The main elements that make up an HTML table include <table>, <tr>, <th>, <td>, and <thead>. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each element and its purpose:

1. <table>
Purpose: The <table> element is the container for the entire table. It defines the table structure and encompasses all the other table-related elements.
Usage: It is used to create a table in HTML. You can set attributes like border, cellpadding, and cellspacing (though CSS is preferred for styling in modern web development).
2. <tr>
Purpose: The <tr> element stands for "table row." It is used to define a row within the table.
Usage: Each <tr> element contains one or more <th> (table header) or <td> (table data) elements. Rows are used to group data horizontally.
3. <th>
Purpose: The <th> element stands for "table header." It is used to define a header cell in a table, which typically contains headings for the columns.
Usage: Header cells are usually bold and centered by default. They help to describe the content of the columns or rows, making the table easier to understand. <th> elements can be used within <tr> elements to create header rows.
4. <td>
Purpose: The <td> element stands for "table data." It is used to define a standard cell in a table that contains data.
Usage: Each <td> element represents a data point within a row. It can contain text, images, links, or other HTML elements. <td> elements are used within <tr> elements to create the body of the table.
5. <thead>
Purpose: The <thead> element is used to group the header content in a table. It helps to semantically separate the header from the body of the table.
Usage: The <thead> element typically contains one or more <tr> elements, each of which can contain <th> elements. Using <thead> improves accessibility and allows for better styling and manipulation of the table header, especially when combined with <tbody> and <tfoot> for larger tables.

 1: What are HTML forms used for? Describe the purpose of the input, textarea,
select, and button elements.

<...HTML forms are used to collect user input and submit it to a server for processing. They are essential for creating interactive web applications, allowing users to enter data, make selections, and perform actions. Forms can be used for various purposes, such as user registration, login, feedback submission, and more.

Hereâ€™s a brief description of the purpose of the key form elements:

1. Input Element (<input>)
The <input> element is used to create various types of input fields where users can enter data. The type of input can be specified using the type attribute, which can take values such as:

text: A single-line text input.
password: A single-line input that hides the entered text (for passwords).
email: A field for entering email addresses, with basic validation.
number: A field for entering numeric values.
checkbox: A box that can be checked or unchecked.
radio: A set of options where only one can be selected at a time.
file: A field for uploading files.
date, time, url, etc.: Specialized fields for specific types of data.
2. Textarea Element (<textarea>)
The <textarea> element is used for multi-line text input. It allows users to enter larger amounts of text, such as comments or messages. The size of the textarea can be controlled using the rows and cols attributes, or through CSS for more precise styling. Unlike the <input> element, which is typically for single-line input, <textarea> is ideal for longer text entries.

3. Select Element (<select>)
The <select> element creates a dropdown list from which users can select one or more options. It is often used when there are multiple choices available, and it helps save space on the form. The options within the dropdown are defined using <option> elements. The <select> element can also be configured to allow multiple selections by adding the multiple attribute.

4. Button Element (<button>)
The <button> element is used to create clickable buttons that can trigger actions when clicked. It can be used to submit a form, reset a form, or perform custom JavaScript actions. The button can contain text or images and can be styled with CSS. There are also specific types of buttons, such as:

submit: Submits the form data to the server.
reset: Resets the form fields to their initial values.
button: A generic button that can be programmed to perform any action using JavaScript.

3.What is the difference between block-level elements and inline elements in
HTML? Provide examples of each

<...Block-Level Elements

Definition: Block-level elements take up the full width available (by default) and start on a new line. They create a "block" of content, which means that any content following a block-level element will appear below it.

    They occupy the entire width of their parent container.
    They start on a new line, meaning they create a break before and after the element.

Examples:

    <div>: A generic container for grouping content.
    <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>: Headings of different levels.
    <p>: Paragraphs of text.
    <ul>: Unordered lists.

    Inline Elements

Definition: Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. They allow content to flow within a block-level element without breaking the flow of text.


    They only occupy the space required for their content.
    They do not create line breaks before or after the element.

Examples:

    <span>: A generic inline container for text or other inline elements.
    <a>: Anchor tag for hyperlinks.
    <strong>: Indicates strong importance (usually displayed as bold).
    <em>: Indicates emphasized text (usually displayed as italic)

<...Role of Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML refers to the use of HTML markup that conveys meaning about the content contained within the elements. Instead of using generic tags (like <div> or <span>), semantic HTML uses elements that describe the role and purpose of the content, making it more understandable for both browsers and developers.


Importance  of Semantic HTML

   1.Accessibility:
        Improved Screen Reader Support: Semantic elements provide context to assistive technologies, such as screen readers. For example, using <header>, <nav>, <main>, and <footer> helps screen readers convey the structure of the page to users with visual impairments.
        Better Navigation: Semantic HTML allows users to navigate content more easily. For instance, a screen reader can quickly jump to different sections of a page based on the semantic tags used.

    2.SEO (Search Engine Optimization):
        Enhanced Search Engine Understanding: Search engines use semantic HTML to better understand the content and context of a web page. This understanding can improve how pages are indexed and ranked in search results.

Examples of Semantic Elements


    1.<header>: Represents introductory content or a group of navigational links. Typically contains headings, logos, or navigation menus.

    2.<nav>: Defines a set of navigation links. It helps search engines and assistive technologies identify the navigation structure of the site.

    3.main>: Represents the main content of the document. There should be only one <main> element per page, and it should contain content that is directly related to the central topic of the page.

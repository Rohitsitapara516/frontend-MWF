3:What is the difference between block-level elements and inline elements in
HTML? Provide examples of each

<...1.Block-Level Elements
Definition: Block-level elements take up the full width available (by default) and start on a new line. They create a "block" of content, which means that they can contain other block-level elements and inline elements.

Characteristics:

Start on a new line.
Take up the full width of their parent container.
Can contain other block-level and inline elements.
Examples:

<div>: A generic container for grouping content.
<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>: Headings of different levels.
<p>: Paragraphs of text.
<ul>, <ol>: Unordered and ordered lists, respectively.
<blockquote>: A section that is quoted from another source.
<section>: A thematic grouping of content.
<article>: A self-contained composition in a document.

2.Inline Elements
Definition: Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. They are typically used to format a small portion of text or to include small elements within a block of text.

Characteristics:

Do not start on a new line.
Only take up as much width as their content requires.
Cannot contain block-level elements (but can contain other inline elements).
Examples:

<span>: A generic inline container for text.
<a>: Anchor tag for hyperlinks.
<strong>: Indicates strong importance, typically displayed as bold text.
<em>: Indicates emphasized text, typically displayed as italicized text.
<img>: Embeds an image.
<br>: Inserts a line break.
<code>: Represents a fragment of computer code.

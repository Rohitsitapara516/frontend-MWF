 1: Explain the structure of an HTML table and the purpose of each of the following
elements: <table>, <tr>, <th>, <td>, and <thead>.

<...An HTML table is a structured way to present data in a grid format, consisting of rows and columns. Each element within a table serves a specific purpose to organize and format the data effectively. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the structure and purpose of each of the specified elements:

1. <table>
Purpose: The <table> element is the container for the entire table. It defines the boundaries of the table and encompasses all the rows and cells within it.
Usage: It can include attributes such as border, cellpadding, and cellspacing to control the appearance of the table, although CSS is often preferred for styling in modern web development.

2. <tr>
Purpose: The <tr> element stands for "table row." It is used to define a single row within the table. Each <tr> can contain one or more cells, which can be either header cells or data cells.
Usage: You can have multiple <tr> elements within a <table>, and they are typically used to group together cells that belong to the same row.

3. <th>
Purpose: The <th> element stands for "table header." It is used to define a header cell in a table, which typically contains headings for the columns. Header cells are usually bold and centered by default.
Usage: <th> elements are often used within a <tr> to provide context for the data in the corresponding columns. They help users understand what type of data is contained in each column.

4. <td>
Purpose: The <td> element stands for "table data." It is used to define a standard cell in a table that contains data. Each <td> represents a single piece of data within a row.
Usage: Like <th>, <td> elements are placed within a <tr>. They can contain text, images, links, or other HTML elements, allowing for a wide variety of content to be displayed in the table.

5. <thead>
Purpose: The <thead> element is used to group the header content in a table. It is a semantic element that helps to define the header section of the table, making it easier to style and manage.
Usage: The <thead> element typically contains one or more <tr> elements, each of which can include <th> elements. It is often used in conjunction with <tbody> (for the body of the table) and <tfoot> (for the footer) to create a more structured and accessible table layout.

1️ What is the Context API in React?

The Context API is a built-in feature in React that allows you to share state/data globally across multiple components without having to pass props manually through every level of the component tree (called prop drilling).

It’s useful when you have data that many components need, like user authentication, theme settings, or language preferences.

2️ How does it work?

The Context API has three main steps:

Create Context → React.createContext()

Provide Context → Wrap components with Context.Provider and pass the shared state.

Consume Context → Use useContext() (or Context.Consumer) inside components to access the data.


How Context API Manages Global State

1.Create a Context (global container)

This acts like a "store" that can hold global state.


2.Wrap components with a Provider

The Provider makes the state available to all child components.

You pass the global state (and functions to update it) into the value prop.


3.Consume the Context in any component

Instead of drilling props down, any component can directly access the global state with useContext().

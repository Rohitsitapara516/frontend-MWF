2: Explain how createContext() and useContext() are used in React for
sharing state.

1. createContext() in React

createContext() is used to create a Context object.

Think of it like making a "global container" where you can store data.

This context can then be provided to components using a Provider.




2. useContext() in React

useContext() is a React hook that lets you consume (read) the context values in any component.

Instead of passing props manually, you just use useContext(MyContext) to get the data.

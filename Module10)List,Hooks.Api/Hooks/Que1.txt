1: What are React hooks? How do useState() and useEffect() hooks work in
functional components?


1. What are React Hooks?

Hooks are special functions introduced in React 16.8 that let you use state and other React features in functional components (without needing class components).

They start with the word use (e.g., useState, useEffect, useContext).

Hooks make functional components more powerful and easier to read.

2. The useState() Hook

useState lets you add state (data that can change) to a functional component.

It returns an array with two values:

The current state value

A function to update that value


3. The useEffect() Hook

useEffect lets you perform side effects in functional components.

Side effects = things that affect the outside world, e.g., fetching data, updating the DOM, timers, logging.

It runs after the component renders.

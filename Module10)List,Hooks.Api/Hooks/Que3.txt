3: What is useReducer ? How we use in react app?

1. What is useReducer in React?

useReducer is a React hook for managing complex state logic.

It’s an alternative to useState, especially useful when:

State has multiple sub-values

State updates depend on previous state

You want a centralized way to handle state transitions (like Redux but lighter).


4. When to Use useReducer vs useState

 Use useState → Simple state (like toggles, form fields, counters).

 Use useReducer → Complex state with multiple values, or when actions describe what happened

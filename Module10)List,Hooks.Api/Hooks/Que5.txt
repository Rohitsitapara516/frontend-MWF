5: Whatâ€™s the Difference between the useCallback & useMemo Hooks?


1. useCallback

Purpose: Memoizes a function.

Prevents the function from being re-created on every render, unless dependencies change.

Useful when passing functions as props to child components (to avoid unnecessary re-renders).


2. useMemo

Purpose: Memoizes a computed value (result).

Prevents re-execution of an expensive calculation, unless dependencies change.

Useful for optimizing performance in heavy computations or derived state.

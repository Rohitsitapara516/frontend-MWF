6 : What is useRef ? How to work in react app?

1. What is useRef?

useRef is a React Hook that lets you create a mutable reference object.

It’s often used for:

Accessing DOM elements directly (like document.getElementById but React-friendly).

Storing values that persist across renders without triggering a re-render.



5. When to Use useRef

To access/manipulate DOM nodes (focus, scroll, play video, etc.).

To store mutable values that don’t cause re-renders (like timers, previous state values, cache).

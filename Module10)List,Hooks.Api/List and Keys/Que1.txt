1. How do you render a list of items in React?

In React, you can render a list by using JavaScript’s .map() function to loop through an array and return JSX for each item.


2. Why is it important to use keys when rendering lists?

Keys help React identify which items have changed, been added, or removed.

Without keys, React re-renders the whole list every time something changes.

With keys, React can update only the item that changed, which is more efficient.

Keys also help React preserve state correctly in dynamic lists (e.g., form inputs inside a list).



Important rule:

Keys should be unique and stable (like an ID from the database).

Avoid using index as a key if the list can change order or have items inserted/removed — it can lead to bugs.

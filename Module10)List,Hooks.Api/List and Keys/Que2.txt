2: What are keys in React, and what happens if you do not provide a unique key?


1. What are keys in React?

Keys are special props you pass to elements in a list.

They are used internally by React to track which items in a list have changed, been added, or removed.

They help React’s reconciliation algorithm decide how to efficiently update the DOM.



2. What happens if you do NOT provide a unique key?

If you don’t provide keys (or provide non-unique ones):

React will fall back to using array indexes as keys.

This can cause inefficient re-renders because React can’t tell which item actually changed.

In dynamic lists (items added/removed/reordered), it can lead to UI bugs such as:

Incorrectly reusing DOM elements

Losing component state (e.g., input fields losing typed text)

Wrong animations/transitions being applied

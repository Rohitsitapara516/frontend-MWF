What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components in React?

Controlled Components
Definition: Form elements whose values are controlled by React state.
Data Flow: The input value is stored in React state, and the UI reflects this state.
How it works:
The form element's value attribute is set to a state variable.
An onChange handler updates the state when the user types.
Advantages:
Single source of truth (React state).
Easy to validate, format, or manipulate input.
Enables conditional rendering based on input.


Uncontrolled Components
Definition: Form elements that maintain their own internal state (like traditional HTML form elements).
Data Flow: The input value is stored in the DOM, not in React state.
How it works:
You use a ref to access the input's current value when needed.
React does not update the input value on every change.
Advantages:
Simpler to implement for simple forms.
Less code for basic use cases.
Disadvantages:
Harder to validate or manipulate input in real-time.
React does not control the input, so UI and state can get out of sync.

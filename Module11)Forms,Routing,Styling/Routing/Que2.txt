2: Explain the difference between BrowserRouter, Route, Link, and Switch
components in React Router.


1. BrowserRouter
Purpose: It is the top-level router component that uses the HTML5 History API (pushState, popstate, etc.) to keep the UI in sync with the URL.
Role: Wraps your entire React application (or the part of it that needs routing) and enables clean URLs without hash fragments 


2. Route
Purpose: Defines a mapping between a URL path and a React component.
Role: When the current URL matches the path prop of a <Route>, it renders the specified component.


3. Link
Purpose: Provides navigation links that update the URL without causing a full page reload.
Role: Renders an anchor (<a>) tag that, when clicked, changes the URL and triggers React Router to render the matching route component.


4. Switch (React Router v5) / Routes (React Router v6)
Purpose: Renders the first child <Route> that matches the current URL.
Role: Ensures that only one route is rendered at a time, preventing multiple routes from rendering simultaneously.

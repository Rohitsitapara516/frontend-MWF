Why do you need to bind event handlers in class components?


Why is binding necessary?
In JavaScript, the value of this inside a function depends on how the function is called.
When you pass a class method as an event handle the method is called without an explicit receiver, so this is undefined (in strict mode) or refers to the global object (in non-strict mode).
React does not automatically bind class methods to the component instance.
Without binding, inside the event handler, this will not refer to the component instance, so you cannot access this.state, this.props, or other instance methods.

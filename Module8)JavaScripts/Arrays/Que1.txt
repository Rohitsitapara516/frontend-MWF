 1: What is an array in JavaScript? How do you declare and initialize an array?
<...

You can declare and initialize an array in JavaScript using two primary methods: the array literal syntax and the Array constructor.

1. Array Literal Syntax
The most common way to create an array is by using the array literal syntax, which involves enclosing a comma-separated list of values in square brackets ([]).

Example:

javascript
// Declaring and initializing an array using array literal syntax
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
In this example, fruits is an array that contains three string elements: "apple", "banana", and "cherry".

2. Array Constructor
You can also create an array using the Array constructor. This method is less common but can be useful in certain situations.

Example:

javascript
// Declaring and initializing an array using the Array constructor
let numbers = new Array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
In this example, numbers is an array created using the Array constructor, containing five numeric elements.

Empty Arrays
You can also declare an empty array and initialize it later by adding elements.

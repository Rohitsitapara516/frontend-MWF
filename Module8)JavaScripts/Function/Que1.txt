 1: What are functions in JavaScript? Explain the syntax for declaring and calling a
function

In JavaScript, functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They allow you to encapsulate logic, making your code more organized, modular, and easier to maintain. Functions can take inputs (known as parameters) and can return outputs (known as return values).

Types of Functions
There are several ways to define functions in JavaScript:

Function Declarations
Function Expressions
Arrow Functions
1. Function Declaration
A function declaration defines a named function that can be called later in the code.

Syntax
javascript
function functionName(parameters) 

Example
javascript
function add(a, b) 
return a + b;
...
2. Function Expression
A function expression defines a function that can be assigned to a variable. This function can be anonymous (without a name) or named.

const functionName = function(parameters) 

Example
javascript
const multiply = function(x, y) 
return x * y;

3. Arrow Function
Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for writing function expressions. They are particularly useful for writing short functions.

Syntax
javascript
const functionName = (parameters) =>
Example
javascript
const subtract = (a, b) => 
return a - b;
Calling a Function
To call a function, you simply use its name followed by parentheses. If the function takes parameters, you pass the arguments inside the parentheses.

Example of Calling Functions
javascript
function greet(name) 
return "Hello, " + name + "!";

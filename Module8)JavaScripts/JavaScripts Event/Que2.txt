2: How does the addEventListener() method work in JavaScript? Provide an
example

<...

The addEventListener() method in JavaScript is used to attach an event handler to a specified element. This enables the element to listen for specific events and execute a function when that event occurs. 
The method takes three arguments:
event:
This is a string that specifies the name of the event to listen for (e.g., 'click', 'mouseover', 'keydown').
function:
This is the function that will be executed when the event occurs. This function is also known as the event handler. 
useCapture:
(Optional) A boolean value that specifies whether the event should be captured or bubbled.
Here's an example:
JavaScript

// Get the button element
const myButton = document.getElementById('myButton');

// Add a click event listener to the button
myButton.addEventListener('click', function() {
  // This code will execute when the button is clicked
  alert('Button clicked!');
});
In this example, when the button with the ID 'myButton' is clicked, an alert message will appear.
Key features of addEventListener():
It can attach multiple event handlers to the same element and event.
It allows for more control over event propagation using the optional useCapture argument.
It provides a more flexible and robust way to handle events in JavaScript compared to traditional methods like onclick.

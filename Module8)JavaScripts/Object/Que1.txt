 1: What is an object in JavaScript? How are objects different from arrays?


<...

In JavaScript, an object is a collection of key-value pairs where each key (also called a property) is a string (or Symbol), and the value can be any data type â€” including another object, function, array, etc.

Syntax example:
let person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
  greet: function() {
    console.log("Hello!");
  }
};
name and age are keys (properties)

"Alice" and 30 are their corresponding values

greet is a method (a function stored as a property)

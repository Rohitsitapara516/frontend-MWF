 1: What are variables in JavaScript? How do you declare a variable using var, let, and const? 

 <...

 In JavaScript, variables are used to store data values. They can hold different types of data, such as numbers, strings, objects, arrays, and more. The way you declare a variable can affect its scope and mutability. There are three main ways to declare variables in JavaScript: using var, let, and const.    

1 var
Scope: Variables declared with var are function-scoped or globally scoped if declared outside a function. They are not block-scoped.
Hoisting: var declarations are hoisted to the top of their containing function or global context, meaning they can be referenced before their declaration.
    
Example:

javascript
8 lines

var x = 10;
function example() 
...
   

2. let
Scope: Variables declared with let are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the block they are defined in (e.g., within a loop or an if statement).
Hoisting: let declarations are also hoisted, but they cannot be accessed before their declaration (temporal dead zone).    
   

3. const
Scope: Similar to let, variables declared with const are block-scoped.
Immutability: const is used to declare variables that cannot be reassigned. However, if the variable holds an object or an array, the contents of that object or array can still be modified.

Example:

const z = 15;
if (true)

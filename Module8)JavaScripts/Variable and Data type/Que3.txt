 3: What is the difference between undefined and null in JavaScript? 


<...

1.Undefined:
A variable is undefined when it has been declared but has not been assigned a value. It is the default value of uninitialized variables.
Example:
javascript
let x;
console.log(x); // Output: undefined
   

2.Null:
null is an intentional assignment of a variable to indicate that it has no value. It is an object type that represents the absence of any object value.
Example:
javascript
let y = null;
console.log(y);

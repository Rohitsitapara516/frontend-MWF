1. Arithmetic Operators
   

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations. The common arithmetic operators include:    

Addition (+): Adds two operands.
javascript
1 lines
Click to expand
let sum = 5 + 3; // Output: 8
   

Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second operand from the first.
javascript
1 lines
Click to expand
let difference = 5 - 3; // Output: 2
   

Multiplication (*): Multiplies two operands.
javascript
1 lines
Click to expand
let product = 5 * 3; // Output: 15
   

Division (/): Divides the first operand by the second.
javascript
1 lines
Click to expand
let quotient = 5 / 2; 
   

   

Exponentiation (**): Raises the first operand to the power of the second.
javascript
1 lines
Click to expand
let power = 2 ** 3; 
   

2. Assignment Operators
   

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. The common assignment operators include:    

Simple Assignment (=): Assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.
javascript
1 lines
Click to expand
let x = 10; 
   

Addition Assignment (+=): Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
javascript
x += 5; // x is now 15
   

Subtraction Assignment (-=): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
javascript
Click to expand
x -= 3;
   

Multiplication Assignment (*=): Multiplies the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
javascript
1 lines
Click to expand
x *= 2; 
   

Division Assignment (/=): Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
javascript
1 lines
Click to expand
x /= 4; 
   

Modulus Assignment (%=): Takes the modulus using two operands and assigns the result to the left operand.
javascript
1 lines
Click to expand
x %= 5; 
   

3. Comparison Operators
   

Comparison operators are used to compare two values and return a boolean result (true or false). The common comparison operators include:    

Equal to (==): Checks if two values are equal (type coercion occurs).
javascript
1 lines
Click to expand
console.log(5 == '5');
   

Strict Equal to (===): Checks if two values are equal and of the same type (no type coercion).
javascript
1 lines
Click to expand
console.log(5 === '5'); 
   

Not Equal to (!=): Checks if two values are not equal (type coercion occurs).
javascript
1 lines
Click to expand
console.log(5 != '5'); 
   

Strict Not Equal to (!==): Checks if two values are not equal or not of the same type.
javascript
1 lines
Click to expand
console.log(5 !== '5'); 
   

Greater than (>): Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
javascript
1 lines
Click to expand
console.log(5 > 3); // 
   

Less than (<): Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.
javascript
1 lines
Click to expand
console.log(5 < 3); 
   

Greater than or Equal to (>=): Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.
javascript
1 lines
Click to expand
console.log(5 >= 5); // 
   

Less than or Equal to (<=): Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.
javascript
1 lines
Click to expand
console.log(5 <= 3); 
   

4. Logical Operators
   

Logical operators are used to combine or negate boolean values. The common logical operators include:    

Logical AND (&&): Returns true if both operands are true.
javascript
1 lines
Click to expand
console.log(true && false); 
   

Logical OR (||): Returns true if at least one of the operands is true.
javascript
1 lines
Click to expand
console.log(true || false); 
   

Logical NOT (!): Negates the boolean value of the operand.
javascript
1 lines
Click to expand
console.log(!true);

2: What is the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop?


<...

The primary difference between a while loop and a do-while loop in JavaScript lies in when the condition is evaluated and how many times the loop body is guaranteed to execute.

1. Condition Evaluation
While Loop: The condition is evaluated before the execution of the loop's body. If the condition is false at the start, the loop body will not execute at all.

Syntax:

javascript
while (condition)
Do-While Loop: The condition is evaluated after the execution of the loop's body. This means that the loop body will always execute at least once, regardless of whether the condition is true or false.

Syntax:

javascript
do 
2. Execution Guarantee
While Loop: There is no guarantee that the loop body will execute even once. If the condition is false from the beginning, the code inside the loop will be skipped entirely.

Do-While Loop: The loop body is guaranteed to execute at least once, even if the condition is false after the first execution.

Example
Hereâ€™s a simple example to illustrate the difference:

While Loop Example
javascript
let count = 0;
while (count < 0) 
Output: No output, as the condition count < 0 is false from the start.

Do-While Loop Example
javascript
let count = 0;
do 
...
Output: "This will be printed once." The loop body executes once before checking the condition, which is false.

<...Explain the basic structure of an HTML document.
The basic structure of an HTML document consists of several key elements that define the document's content and how it should be displayed in a web browser. Below is an overview of the basic structure, including the mandatory tags and their purposes:

1.<!DOCTYPE html>:
Purpose: This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML being used. It helps the browser render the page correctly. In this case, it indicates that the document is an HTML5 document.

2.<html>:
Purpose: This tag is the root element of an HTML document. It wraps all the content on the page and can include attributes like lang to specify the language of the document.

3.<head>:
Purpose: The <head> section contains meta-information about the document, such as its title, character set, and links to stylesheets or scripts. This information is not displayed directly on the web page.

4.<meta charset="UTF-8">:
Purpose: This tag specifies the character encoding for the document. UTF-8 is a widely used encoding that supports many characters from different languages.

5.<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">:
Purpose: This tag is essential for responsive web design. It controls the layout on mobile browsers by setting the viewport width to the device's width and the initial zoom level.

6.<title>:
Purpose: The <title> tag defines the title of the document, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab. It is also important for SEO as it helps search engines understand the content of the page.

7.<body>:
Purpose: The <body> section contains the content of the web page that is visible to users, including text, images, links, and other elements.

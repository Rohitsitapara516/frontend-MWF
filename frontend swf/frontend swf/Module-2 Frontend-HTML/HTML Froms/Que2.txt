2: Explain the difference between the GET and POST methods in form submission.
When should each be used?

<...GET Method

Characteristics:
Data Transmission: Data is appended to the URL as query parameters. For example, if a form submits a username and password, the URL might look like this: http://example.com/login?username=user&password=pass.
Visibility: The data sent via GET is visible in the URL, which can be bookmarked or shared. This makes it less secure for sensitive information (like passwords).
Data Length: There is a limit to the amount of data that can be sent using GET, typically around 2048 characters, depending on the browser and server.
Caching: GET requests can be cached by browsers, which can improve performance for repeated requests.

When to Use GET:
When retrieving data from the server without causing any side effects (e.g., searching, filtering, or displaying information).
When the data is not sensitive and can be safely included in the URL.
When you want the request to be bookmarkable or shareable.

POST Method

Characteristics:
Data Transmission: Data is sent in the body of the HTTP request, not in the URL. This means the data is not visible in the URL.
Visibility: The data sent via POST is not displayed in the URL, making it more secure for transmitting sensitive information.
Data Length: There is no strict limit on the amount of data that can be sent using POST, allowing for larger payloads.
Caching: POST requests are generally not cached by browsers.

When to Use POST:
When submitting data that modifies the server state (e.g., creating, updating, or deleting resources).
When sending sensitive information (e.g., passwords, personal data) that should not be exposed in the URL.
When the amount of data being sent is large or complex.

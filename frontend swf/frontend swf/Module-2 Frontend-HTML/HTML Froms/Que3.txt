3: What is the purpose of the label element in a form, and how does it improve
accessibility?

<....Purpose of the <label> Element
1.Associating Labels with Inputs:

The primary purpose of the <label> element is to provide a user-friendly description for form controls (like <input>, <textarea>, and <select>). It helps users understand what information is required in each input field.
The <label> can be associated with a specific input element using the for attribute, which should match the id of the corresponding input. This association allows users to click on the label to focus on the input field, enhancing the user experience.

How <label> Improves Accessibility

1.Screen Reader Support:
Screen readers, which are used by visually impaired users, read out the label text when the associated input field is focused. This provides context and helps users understand what information they need to enter.
Without labels, users relying on screen readers may struggle to understand the purpose of each input field, leading to confusion and potential errors.

2.Clickable Labels:
When a label is associated with an input field, clicking on the label will focus the corresponding input. This is particularly helpful for users with motor impairments who may find it difficult to click small input fields directly.
This feature enhances usability by making it easier for all users to interact with forms.

3.Improved Form Navigation:
Labels provide clear instructions and context for each input field, making it easier for users to navigate and complete forms. This is especially important for longer forms where users may need guidance on what information is required.

4.Visual Clarity:
Labels help create a visually organized form layout. They provide a clear structure, making it easier for all users to understand the form's purpose and the information being requested

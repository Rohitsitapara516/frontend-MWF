2: What is the difference between colspan and rowspan in tables? Provide
examples.

<...In HTML tables, colspan and rowspan are attributes used with the <td> (table data) and <th> (table header) elements to control how many columns or rows a cell should span. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of each, along with examples:

1. colspan
Definition: The colspan attribute specifies the number of columns a cell should span across. This allows a single cell to extend horizontally across multiple columns.

Usage: It is useful for creating headers or cells that need to encompass multiple columns of data.


2. rowspan
Definition: The rowspan attribute specifies the number of rows a cell should span vertically. This allows a single cell to extend across multiple rows.

Usage: It is useful for creating cells that need to represent data that applies to multiple rows.

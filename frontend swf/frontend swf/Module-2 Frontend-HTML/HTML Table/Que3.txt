3: Why should tables be used sparingly for layout purposes? What is a better
alternative?

<...Tables for Layout
1.Semantic Meaning:
Tables are designed to present tabular data, not for layout. Using them for layout purposes can confuse the semantic meaning of the HTML, making it harder for search engines and assistive technologies (like screen readers) to interpret the content correctly.

2.Accessibility:
Screen readers and other assistive technologies expect tables to contain data. If tables are misused for layout, it can lead to a poor user experience for individuals relying on these technologies, as they may not be able to navigate the content effectively.

3.Maintenance and Flexibility:
Layouts created with tables can be more difficult to maintain and modify. Changes to the layout often require significant adjustments to the table structure, which can lead to complex and messy code.

4.Responsiveness:
Tables are not inherently responsive. When using tables for layout, it can be challenging to make them adapt to different screen sizes and devices. This can lead to a poor user experience on mobile devices.

5.Performance:
Tables can lead to larger HTML files and slower rendering times, especially if they are complex and nested. This can negatively impact page load times and overall performance.

Better Alternatives

1.CSS Flexbox:
Flexbox is a layout model that allows for responsive design and alignment of elements in a one-dimensional space (either row or column). It provides greater control over the layout and is easier to manage than tables.

2.CSS Grid:
CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that allows for more complex layouts. It provides a powerful way to create responsive designs with rows and columns.

3.CSS Frameworks:
Frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation provide pre-defined classes and components that help create responsive layouts without the need for tables. They utilize Flexbox and Grid under the hood, making it easier to build modern, responsive designs.

4.Media Queries:
CSS media queries allow for responsive design by applying different styles based on the screen size. This ensures that layouts adapt to various devices without relying on table

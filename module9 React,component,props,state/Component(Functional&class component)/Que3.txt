3: What is the role of render() in class components?


Role of render() in Class Components
The render() method is a required method in every React class component.
It returns the JSX (or React elements) that define what should be displayed on the screen.
React calls the render() method whenever the component’s state or props change, to determine the updated UI.
The output of render() must be a single React element (which can contain nested elements).

Key Points
It describes what the UI looks like for that component.
It should be a pure function: it should return the same output given the same props and state, and should not modify component state or interact with the browser directly.
It does not handle side effects or data fetching — those are handled in lifecycle methods like componentDidMount.

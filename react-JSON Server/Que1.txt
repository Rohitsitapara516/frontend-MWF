1: What do you mean by RESTful web services?

Key characteristics of RESTful web services include:

Statelessness: Each request from a client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server does not store any client context between requests.

Client-Server Architecture: The client and server are separate entities that interact through requests and responses. This separation allows each to evolve independently.

Uniform Interface: RESTful services use a uniform and predefined set of operations, typically HTTP methods such as:

GET: Retrieve a resource
POST: Create a new resource
PUT: Update an existing resource
DELETE: Remove a resource
Resource-Based: Resources (data or services) are identified by URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). Each resource can have multiple representations, such as JSON, XML, or HTML.

Cacheable: Responses must define themselves as cacheable or non-cacheable to improve client efficiency.

Layered System: The architecture can be composed of multiple layers, with each layer interacting only with the adjacent layers.

 2: What is Json-Server? How we use in React ?

 What is JSON Server?
JSON Server is a simple, full fake REST API that you can use to quickly set up a mock backend for prototyping and testing front-end applications. It allows you to create a RESTful API with zero coding by using a simple JSON file as your database.




How to Use JSON Server in React
Step 1: Install JSON Server
First, you need to install JSON Server globally or locally in your project.

To install globally (so you can run it from anywhere):
bash


npm install -g json-server
Or install it as a dev dependency in your React project:
bash


npm install --save-dev json-server
Step 2: Create a db.json File
Create a file named db.json in your project root folder. This file will act as your fake database.

Example content of db.json:


{
"posts": [
...
Step 3: Start JSON Server
Run the following command in your terminal to start the JSON Server and watch the db.json file:


json-server --watch db.json --port 3001
This will start a REST API server at http://localhost:3001.
The --port 3001 option is used to avoid conflict if your React app runs on port 3000.
Step 4: Fetch Data in React
In your React app, you can now fetch data from the JSON Server API endpoints.

Example React component to fetch and display posts:

import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
...
Step 5: Perform CRUD Operations
You can also perform Create, Update, and Delete operations by sending POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests to the JSON Server endpoints.

Example: Adding a new post (POST request)

function addPost() 
fetch('http://localhost:3001/posts'), 
...

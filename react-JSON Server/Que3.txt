How to Fetch Data from a JSON Server API in React
To fetch data from a JSON Server API in a React application, you typically use HTTP client methods like fetch() (native JavaScript) or axios (a popular third-party library). These methods allow your React app to send requests to the JSON Server endpoints and receive data asynchronously.



Role of fetch() and axios() in Making API Requests
fetch():

A built-in JavaScript function for making HTTP requests.
Returns a Promise that resolves to the Response object.
Requires manual parsing of the response (e.g., .json()).
Supports modern features like streaming and request cancellation with AbortController.
Lightweight and no additional installation needed.
axios:

A third-party HTTP client library.
Returns a Promise that resolves directly to the response data (no need to call .json()).
Supports features like request/response interceptors, automatic JSON transformation, timeout, and easier error handling.
Works in both browser and Node.js environments.
Requires installation via npm/yarn.

What is Firebase?
Firebase is a comprehensive platform developed by Google that provides a suite of cloud-based tools and services to help developers build, improve, and grow web and mobile applications. It offers backend-as-a-service (BaaS), enabling developers to focus on building the frontend and user experience without worrying about managing servers or infrastructure.

Firebase simplifies app development by providing ready-to-use services such as real-time databases, authentication, hosting, analytics, and more.

Key Features of Firebase
Realtime Database

A NoSQL cloud database that stores and syncs data in real-time across all connected clients.
Enables live, collaborative applications with instant data updates.
Cloud Firestore

A flexible, scalable NoSQL document database.
Supports richer queries and offline data access.
Authentication

Provides easy-to-use SDKs and backend services to authenticate users.
Supports multiple authentication methods: email/password, phone, Google, Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, and more.
Cloud Functions

Serverless functions that run backend code in response to events triggered by Firebase features or HTTPS requests.
